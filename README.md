## What is it?
This is a simple Password Generator that will ask confirmations on various characters the user would like to include in a randomly generated password.

## Why did I make this?

This solves the problem of having to try to think of a password that would be hard to guess by any would-be hackers and/or keep kids/room-mates from guessing my passwords with any ease.


## How did I go about building this?
A small mix of HTML, and lots of JavaScript with if statements, and some functions were used and carefully placed to allow the application to perform its intended purpose.
